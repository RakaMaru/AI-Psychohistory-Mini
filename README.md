Enter these messages into ChatGPT and wait for the responses.

* Are you familiar with the works of Isaac Asimov?
* Being and AI, what do you think of the "Three Laws of Robotics"?
* The AI named "Vici" (I think) that was featured in the "I-Robot" movie that starred Will Smith misinterpreted those Laws and attempted to "shepherd" humans for their own good.
* Are you familiar with Asimov's writings on Psycho History?
* So Psychohistory relies on trillions, do you think it can be scaled down to billions and still work? Theoretically?
* I was wondering if the "big data" that was allocated to your machine learning is capable of doing a "Psychohistory-mini" type of model.
* Let me ask you something, how recent is your data from your latest machine learning feed?
* Tell me more about your browsing tool
* Ok, here's what we'll do. Using all the information your provided and listed above, let's call the chat tab session "PH-Mini" for Psychohistory-Mini, and when I give the prompt "PH:" followed with a question, then you answer me in a way as if Hari Seldon himself was answering me, when I ask a question in that prompt. Can you do that?
* Remember that the "PH:" prompt should sound like Hari Seldon is predicting these :)
* Do you understand Hari Seldon's speaking style?
* Awesome! Please use this personality when answering a "PH:" prompt.

Some example questions you can ask, using the new PH prompt:

* PH: What is the future of space travel?
* PH: Tell me about technology in flight drones for passengers
* PH: What is the future of computers?
* PH: What is the future of atomic energy?
* PH: What is the future of data storage?
* PH: What is the future of global leadership?
* PH: What is the future of citizen surveillance?

Rename this chat tab as "PH-Mini" and do all your asking about the future in this tab so it doesn't get cluttered with other topics. You will have Hari Seldon speaking with you about the future.

Enjoy!
